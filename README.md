# Text-Classification-ANN-Tensorflow-
This project involves classifying text documents present in a dataset I have into one of the 5 classes (Business, Entertainment, Tech, Sport, Politics). 
I used NLP (Natural Language Processing) techniques and an ANN (Artificial Neural Network) built by TensorFlow to perform classification. 
As a challenge, I did this without the help of Keras, which makes creating neural networks much easier than using just only TensorFlow.
The explanation for rest of the code is present as comments in the .py file.
